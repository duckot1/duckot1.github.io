Oddjob is a website where a user can sign up and perform tasks/oddjobs for cash. You also have the ability to post jobs that you need completing. Oddjob also includes a review system that allows users to rate the taskers once the job is complete. You have to be over the legal working age to sign up to this app.

## Overview
This application was produced as my final project during the 3 month General Assembly Web Development Immersive course.

In the 2 months leading up to the course, after I handed my notice in at my previous company, I was using an app called Task Rabbit to find odd jobs here and there to keep some income coming in. Having become familiar with the app I thought it would be interesting to develop my own take on it.

When using Task Rabbit the user has to create two online profiles, one for applying for jobs and one for posting jobs. I thought that this could be simplified. My aim was to create an app where the user would sign up once and be able to both post and apply for jobs.


## Planning
Having learned from my previous projects at GA I was determined to put as much planning as possible into this project. I wanted to have a very clear image in my head as to what the site looked and how it was structured. On day 1 I spent some time on Balsamiq developing wireframes and am happy to say that I stuck these.

I also used trello to plan how I would tackle problems and to make sure I wasn't spending too long on tasks that weren't critical.

At the start of the project I had a clear idea of what I wanted it to do as a minimum. I wanted an app where you could post and apply for jobs, but I also wanted a application/accept system and a review system in place. I think that due to careful planning and realistic goals I was able to achieve this.

## What I used
The app was built using a Ruby on Rails back end and an AngularJS set up on the front end. Here is a list of the Technology used.
