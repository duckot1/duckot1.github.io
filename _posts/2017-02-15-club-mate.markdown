An app designed to bring people together through a shared interest in an event. My role in the project was mainly on the back end. I was in charge of server side authentication using BCrypt as well as implementing a request/accept system for the events. We worked well as a group, making sure to have regular stand-ups to discuss progress and what tasks we were working on.
